# Overview

LocalePlus is a Flutter package that allows developers to easily retrieve data from the native device locale settings.

This makes it easy to build internationalized apps that provide a personalized experience for each user.

With a simple and intuitive API, LocalePlus is the perfect tool for any Flutter developer looking to add localization to their app.
